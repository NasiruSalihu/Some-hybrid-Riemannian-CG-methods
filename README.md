This repository provides a solver of [pymanopt](https://github.com/NasiruSalihu/Some-hybrid-RCG-methods.git),
which is an implementation of the "Some hybrid Riemannian conjugate gradient
methods with restart strategy".


All numerical examples presented in the paper are used this implementation.

## Experiments
The experiments follow the examples of [pymanopt](https://github.com/NasiruSalihu/Some-hybrid-RCG-methods.git).
